Class "RMQ_succinct" in files "RMQ_succinct.[c|h]pp" implements the
succinct representation of RMQ information.

Type "make" to get an executable "testRMQ" which, when run, creates
a random array of length 5,000,000  and tests the data structure by
posing 1,000 random RMQs to the array and comparing the result with
the naive algorithm for RMQ ("RMQ_1_n.[c|h]pp"). Comparing with the
*naive*  method is also the  reason why it  takes so long!  See how
blindingly fast the test is without the naive algorithm.

Implementation details:
=======================
- Block size s fixed to 8 and superblock size s'' to 256.
- There is an intermediate block-layer of size 16  which is actually
  not  implemented  (as a block consists of  two microblocks).  This
  saves a lot of space in practice for tables M and M'. For details,
  see my doctoral thesis (to appear) or ask via an e-mail.
- Currently just implemented for 32-bit architectures. I've tried to
  make appropriate comments in the code where changes should be made
  for 64-bit computing.
