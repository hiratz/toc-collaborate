Stanza Triad Benchmark

The stanza triad benchmark measures memory bandwidth for a memory
access pattern that consists of a series of triads followed by
a large jump in memory.  See http://crd.lbl.gov/~oliker/msp_2005.pdf
for more information.

Compiling:
> gcc -O3 stanza_triad.c -o stanza_triad

If timers are not automatically detected, you can use gettimeofday() with
> gcc -O3 -DHAVE_GETTIMEOFDAY stanza_triad.c -o stanza_triad
or PAPI with
> gcc -O3 -DHAVE_PAPI stanza_triad.c -o stanza_triad

Running:
Run the executable with no arguments to get a description of the inputs.

Try to use as large of an array as possible; we recommend using an 
array size of .25*(available memory in doublewords).

The output is the measured bandwidth with each stanza length.

Bug Reports:
Please send all bug reports to skamil@cs.berkeley.edu.
