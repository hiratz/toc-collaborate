To Whom It May Concern:

I plan to collaborate with Professors Charles E. Leiserson, Steven
G. Johnson, and Rezaul A. Chowdhury on the research described in their
proposal, ``SHF: AF: Medium: Collaborative Research: The Pochoir
Stencil Compiler.''  I would like to explore how Pochoir technology
can be embedded in the GCC and Intel C/C++ compilers.  In addition, I
hope to study whether Pochoir can be enhanced by autotuning
technology.  I will be funded by Intel for this collaboration and
require no NSF funding.

Sincerely,

Chi-Keung Luk
Senior Staff Engineer
