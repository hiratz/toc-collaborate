To Whom It May Concern:

I wish to express my interest in collaborating on the research of
Professors Charles E. Leiserson, Steven G. Johnson, and Rezaul
A. Chowdhury as described in their research proposal, ``SHF: AF:
Medium: Collaborative Research: The Pochoir Stencil Compiler.''  In
particular, I plan to contribute to the core compiler software for the
Pochoir system.  I will be separately funded by my university and do
not seek any NSF funding for this collaboration.

Sincerely,

Yuan Tang
Assistant Professor
