Here are things the reviewers thought could be improved.  After each item (on the next line) we should write down how we resolved the issue.

Review 1:

Nothing

Review 2:

* Explanation of the name "Pochoir"
* Analysis seems to require too much familiarity with previous wokr [13,14,15]
* Inequalities for r and gamma in thms 2 and 3 seem weird.
* Empirical study should compare agains tsomething more state of the art (e.g., [23])  Compares only to loop
- Berkeley guys just didn't respond to our request of performance comparison.
* Entry 18 in bibliography seems incomplete
- Fixed!

Review 3:

* Related literature and systems (autotuning, venkatasubramian and vudak...)
* Performance evaluation inadeqauate: compares only to loop.

Review 4:

* Comparing only to loop.  SHould compare to something like Roofline or existing stencil autotuners
- Unfortunately, Roofline and Berkeley's software is not publicly available.
* What is the "full version" about?
* Didn't like the performance results in the introduction.
* Little information on the compiler (how does it parse, what are its limits, how are the transformations implemented).
- I have augmented as much info about how the Pochoir compiler works in section 4.1 and 4.3.
* How is Pochoir employing ISAT
* Minor things:
 - p2 "number of grid points that fit on a line" -- is this referring to a cache line? it is unclear from context.
 -- Fixed!
 - p3 Fig 1 caption: I don't see "pairs" of arguments here.
 - p6 "a serial loops" should be "a serial loop"
 - p7 "respresent the offset of each memory footprint relative to the space-time point" is very confusing.  unless the reader has a detailed understanding of Frigo and Strumpen's algorithm, the sentence is difficult to parse.
 - p11 "to user's specification" should be "to a user's specification."
