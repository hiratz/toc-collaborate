Problem formulation:

Given a $g \times m$ ($g$ rows, $m$ columns) bit-matrix, each entry of
which is either $0$ or $1$. Suppose that initially all rows and columns
are distinct, we can put ``x'' on some entries of the bit-matrix to
make these columns identical. For example, in following $3 \times 3$
bit-matrix, if we put ``x'' on entries $(2, 0)$ and $(2, 1)$ \footnote{
all coordinates of bit-matrix follows a convention in programming language
{C}}, we can make the first and second column identical like that shown
on the right-hand side.

\[ 
\begin{pmatrix} 
0 & 0 & 1 \\ 
1 & 1 & 0 \\ 
0 & 1 & 0 
\end{pmatrix}
\Longrightarrow 
\begin{pmatrix} 
0 & 0 & 1 \\ 
1 & 1 & 0 \\ 
x & x & 0 
\end{pmatrix} 
\]

However, columns such as those in pairs $(\{0, 1, x\}^T, \{0, 1, 1\}^T)$ 
or $(\{0, 1, 0\}^T, \{0, 1, x\})$ are not considered identical.

The question is: how to find the minimum number of ``x'' we should place
on any $g \times m$ bit-matrix to make the number of distinct columns
less than or equal to a given number $k$ ($k \leq m$)
