The extension of code-clone selection puzzle from point to region is 
straightforward. The differences are

\begin{itemize}
\item The entry in bit-matrix can be 'x'. $\{0, 1, x\}$

\item The 'x' in bit-matrix comes from contraction of a whole region to 
one bit-vector via bit-wise operation $\otimes$

\item After this contraction, each bit-vector will be associated with
a weight $w_i$ to denote the number of points it represents.

\item In computing the $k$-medians out of the {DAG}, we also need to 
take the weights of each node into account. 
\end{itemize}

But the basic algorithm and complexity bound shouldn't change.
